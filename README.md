# Benchmark Suite

## What is it?

A young framework for executing Java code benchmarks.

### Basic concept

The concept of the suite is to run multiple benchmarks in a row
and then output the results in CSV format.

Each benchmark run is split into a warmup phase and a run phase.
The warmup phase is to fill the cache lines and/or to give the JIT compiler
of the JDK a little time to compile and optimize the code.

## Usage

Usage is thru the command line. 

The following options are available:

```
 -charset (-c) VAL              : Output CSV file charset to use. (default:
                                  ISO-8859-15)
 -checkNano (-C)                : Check nano timing of JDK (default: false)
 -execute (-e) REGEX            : Regex defining which benchmark IDs to
                                  execute. (default: .*)
 -help (-h)                     : Show this command line help. (default: false)
 -list-benchmarks (-l)          : Show the available benchmarks and then exit
                                  (default: false)
 -list-suites (-L)              : Show the available benchmark suites and then
                                  exit (default: false)
 -output (-out, -o) FILE        : Output CSV file to write to. (default:
                                  out.csv)
 -runTime (-r, -run) SECS       : Run up time in seconds for each benchmark.
                                  The performance within this IS benchmarked.
                                  (default: 30)
 -suite (-s) VAL                : The benchmark suite(s) to execute benchmarks
                                  of.
 -warmUpTime (-w, -warmup) SECS : Warm up time in seconds for each benchmark.
                                  The performance within this is NOT
                                  benchmarked. (default: 5)
