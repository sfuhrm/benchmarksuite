Benchmark Suite 
===================
![Travis CI Status](https://travis-ci.org/sfuhrm/benchmarksuite.svg?branch=master)

## What is it?

A young framework for executing Java code benchmarks.

### Basic concept

The concept of the suite is to run multiple benchmarks in a row
and then output the results in CSV format.

Each benchmark run is split into a warmup phase and a run phase.
The warmup phase is to fill the cache lines and/or to give the JIT compiler
of the JDK a little time to compile and optimize the code.

### Suite versus benchmark

A suite is a set of benchmarks that somehow belong to each other.
An example would be a benchmark for reading files with 1k, 4k, 8k and 16k.
Each size would be tested by a benchmark, and all benchmarks
together are a suite.

## Usage

Usage is thru the command line. 

The following options are available:

```
 -charset (-c) VAL                      : Output CSV file charset to use.
                                          (default: ISO-8859-15)
 -check-nano (-C, -checkNano)           : Check nano timing of JDK (default:
                                          false)
 -decimal-dot (-d) VAL                  : The decimal dot sign to use (default:
                                          .)
 -execute (-e) REGEX                    : Regex defining which benchmark IDs to
                                          execute. (default: .*)
 -help (-h)                             : Show this command line help.
                                          (default: true)
 -list-benchmarks (-l)                  : Show the available benchmarks and
                                          then exit (default: false)
 -list-suites (-L)                      : Show the available benchmark suites
                                          and then exit (default: false)
 -output (-out, -o) FILE                : Output CSV file to write to.
                                          (default: out.csv)
 -package-root (-R) VAL                 : The root package to search benchmark
                                          suites in. (default: de.sfuhrm.benchma
                                          rksuite)
 -run-time (-r, -run, -runTime) SECS    : Run up time in seconds for each
                                          benchmark. The performance within
                                          this IS benchmarked. (default: 30)
 -suite (-s) VAL                        : The benchmark suite(s) to execute
                                          benchmarks of.
 -warm-up-time (-w, -warmup,            : Warm up time in seconds for each
 -warmUpTime) SECS                        benchmark. The performance within
                                          this is NOT benchmarked. (default: 5)```
```
